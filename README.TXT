This project was done as part of the Programming Practice and Applications 
course at King's College London, by a team of four: Ejaz Karim, Godfrey Gomes,
Mateusz Adamski and Alexandru Matei. Some of the code was written by the creators
of the assignment, as a starting point for our work.

Alexandru Matei predominantly worked on the statistics panel.
